# My Portfolio 

### Introduction
I’ve had the opportunity to work on a number of incredible projects that I’m pleased to share. Not only do I enjoy showcasing my work, but also sharing details about the creative process behind each project. Feel free to browse through my portfolio.

### Physics Engine C
This is my 4th year project on game engine mechanics such as physics, AI, and automata's. In this project the player can control a goat player object that's object is to collect points and a key to escape a maze, while there is a goose AI that chases the player and points. The game has a time limit of 60 seconds. There are also menus in which the game can be pause and the player can increase or reduce there move speed to change the games difficulty.

Learning Outcomes:
- Experience programming a C++ physics based engine
- Programmed three implementations of AI/state-based behaviours
- Implemented and applied pathfinding algorithms to AI agents

What Could Be Improved:
- Orientation constraints could have been implemented
- Pathfinding could be improved by implementing nav meshes
- More gameplay elements could be added such as better level design/textures
- A proper menu system that appears in game using middleware

### Programmatic-Planet-Rendering
This was my dissertation project for 3rd year, the aim of this project was to implement a variety of methods of procedural generation. Then record performance metrics of these methods at many levels of fidelity, and in evaluation compare them against one another.

### CSC3231-UnityGraphics
This project was an early 3rd year unity project. This was an introduction into game developments aspects such as shaders, scene graphs and particle systems. Its a rough piece of work that I have included as it contains some work I'm proud such as the water shader, camera controls and billboards.

### OpenGLGraphics
4th year C++ project that's focus was on creating a graphics rendering system. This included implementing features such as multiple lights, scene graphs and bump mapping, among others to create a scene that a scene that contains these features while maintaining a high frame rate. This scene also includes shaders that implement greyscale and blending.

Learning Outcomes:
- Used OpenGL to bind and execute shaders in GLSL
- Implemented a scene with multiple light sources
- Used and applied post processing techniques

What Could Be Improved:
- Lighting model could be improved with shadow mapping
- Reflections of mesh geometry could be added to water
- More geometry could be added to main scene along with the animated skeletal mesh
